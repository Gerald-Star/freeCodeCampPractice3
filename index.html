        <h5>CSS Transform scale Property to Scale an Element on Hover</h5>

        <p>
            The transform property has a variety of functions that let you scale, move, rotate, skew, etc., your elements. When used with pseudo-classes such as :hover that specify a certain state of an element, the transform property can easily add interactivity to your elements.
            Here's an example to scale the paragraph elements to 2.1 times their original size when a user hovers over them:

            p:hover {
            transform: scale(2.1);
            }

        </p>

        <h5>CSS Transform Property skewX to Skew an Element Along the X-Axis</h5>

        <p>he next function of the transform property is skewX(), which skews the selected element along its X (horizontal) axis by a given degree.

        The following code skews the paragraph element by -32 degrees along the X-axis.

        p{
         transform: skewX(-32deg);
        }
        <br> <br>

        <div class="skew" id="top"></div>
        <div class="skew" id="bottom"></div>
